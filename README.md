## Design
What was most helpful about thinking about design methods for your project?

- Storyboard helped our group the most for the project. It allowed us to design with users performing a task which was a simple way to start our focus bot.

What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

- The most difficult part for designing was to figure out the automated part of the bot. Also, the exact task and goal for the bot was hard to determine at first. WIth the help of the professor and peers we were able to find the set path for the project. One thing I would do differently was do more research to find details.

What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

- I would like to try the flow maps in the future as it provides more detail of where user’s actions lead them to.

## Implementation
What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?

- The most helpful thing that helped our group in implementing UML, especially use cases, was that it allowed us to figure out which functions were needed and how to implement relationships between functions. For testing and integrations, online resources helped a lot. 

What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

- Figuring out which sources like imports to use was the most difficult. With no prior knowledge, the starting process took longer than we thought. One thing I would do differently would be to have the group start more earlier.

What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

- I would definitely use UML more in the future as it helped so much for this project. I would also try different types of testing in the future.

## Process
What was most helpful about implementing kanban and code review in your project?

- The most helpful thing was that we were able to check and identify the progress of the project. With code review, the code was safer as it was double checked. 

What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

- Working out collision between the code was difficult. There were collisions because the work wasn’t spread out correctly which I would do differently in the future.

What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?

- I would keep using git branches and issues along with the code review process in the future.
## Overall
Considering all the design methods, implementation practices, and software processes you've encountered---compare and contrast how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.
 
- For the design process, I believe that the storyboards benefit for those programs that relate to actions. For example, procedural programs like chat bot which do not really have objects benefit from storyboards. Those programs which depend on UI and OOP benefit more from wireframes and flow maps. They show UI and show how different buttons or screens interact with each other. SImilarly for UML, class diagrams are for object oriented application and sequence diagram is more for action based program. They can be used for others, but would not benefit the most. In the agile software process, there are many methods, but they all are valid because they share the same values which are individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change. In conclusion, different practices of developing software depend on which type of software is being made, but mostly work in most cases as it was well developed strategies by many people.
